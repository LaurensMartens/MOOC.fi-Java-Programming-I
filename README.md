# MOOC.fi-Java-Programming-I
These are projects made during my online course Java Programming I by the University of Helsinki.

PART-01 The first week of the Java Programming I course focused on printing, reading input, variables, calculations and conditional statements.
PART-02 The second week was focused on further exploring conditional statements, loops (while & for), and using the factorial in Java.
