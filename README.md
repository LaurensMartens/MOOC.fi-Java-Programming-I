# MOOC.fi-Java-Programming-I
These are projects made during my online course Java Programming I by the University of Helsinki.

PART-01 The first week of the Java Programming I course focused on printing, reading input, variables, calculations and conditional statements.

PART-02 The second week was focused on further exploring conditional statements, loops (while & for), and using the factorial in Java.

PART-03 The third week primarely explored error handling, string handling, arrays and lists/arraylists.

PART-04 The fourth week was an introduction to the object-oriented programming principles in Java (instance variables, constructors, class methods...)

PART-05 The fifth week further explored object-oriented programming (method & constructor overloading), reading file data, overriding, primitive vs reference variables...

PART-06 The sixth week gave an introduction to manual testing with System.out.println, testing with JUnit and explained how to seperate user interface from programm logic.

PART-07 The seventh week was focused on programming paradigms, algorithms and testing all previous acquired knowledge with large exercises.
